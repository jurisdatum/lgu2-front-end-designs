			<p>Our Changes to legislation search tool is a great way to discover how a piece of legislation has changed, and has been changed by, other legislation. The advanced search provides extra ways to find legislation by type, or by a range of years. If you are interested in trends and patterns in legislation, or how language has changed over time, you will find all the tools you need on our Research website. You can now access judgments and decisions to see how legislation has been applied and interpreted in courts and tribunals by visiting the Find Case Law website. If you are creating your own legislation service or reusing legislation data in your own projects, you can make use of our legislation API.</p>
